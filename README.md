# SemProject

This project is designed to implement an attendance system using facial recognition technology. The system works by capturing images of individuals and comparing them to a database of known images to identify individuals and log their attendance.

Motivation
The goal of this project is to provide a simple yet effective way of tracking attendance for events or classes. With facial recognition technology, the attendance process becomes automated and streamlined, reducing the need for manual attendance tracking and improving accuracy.

Features-
Facial recognition attendance tracking
Automatic image encoding for recognition
Database storage for attendance logs

To get started with this project, you will need to have the following:
